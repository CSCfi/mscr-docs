# Metadata Schema and Crosswalk Registry
MSCR allows registered users and communities to create, register and version schemas and crosswalks with PIDs. The published content can be searched, browsed and downloaded without restrictions. MSCR provides an API to facilitate the transformation of data from one schema to another via registered crosswalks. 

- MSCR supports registering schemas/crosswalks hosted elsewhere as well hosting them in the repository
- It offers basic data management support: PIDs, metadata, versioning and provenance information.
- Supports a GUI for visually creating crosswalks between metadata schemas
- Provides an API and guidelines for organisations to register and maintain metadata schemas and crosswalks
- When registering metadata schema users are able to provide detailed data-type information for fields and attributes using the DTR
- Provides a (meta-)data interoperability service that facilitates conversion between metadata schemas

## MSCR Concepts
Before diving into using Metadata Schema and Crosswalk Registry, it will be helpful the basic concepts and vocubularies used in MSCR (See [MSCR Concepts](mscr/functional-overview.md))

## MSCR Web UI
To register contents and create crosswalks, please go to [MSCR Test Instance](https://mscr-test.2.rahtiapp.fi/). This MSCR version is the test version where users can play around with different MSCR features and get the basic idea of what MSCR can provide. Its good to remember that untill the stable release version is available, all the data are subject to remove if needed. For using the web app see the basic UI guidelines [MSCR UI Guide](mscr/ui-guide.md)

You can also access the stable release version of MSCR application here [MSCR Release Instance](https://mscr-release.2.rahtiapp.fi/).This is very close to the pruduction environment which will be availabe soon and content stored there are more likely to stay for future use.
